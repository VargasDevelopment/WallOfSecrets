# WallOfSecrets
A project I developed for Introduction to Security, CSCE 4550 at UNT during the Fall 2017 Semester.

## Description
This project was created to showcase the utility and limitations of the [Vigenere Cipher](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vigen%C3%A8re_cipher).

## To Run
Clone the project into a directory of your chooosing. Then, in a shell, navigate to the directory and type "python manage.py runserver 8000". The webserver will start serving on port 8000. You can navigate to 127.0.0.1:8000 to interact with the project.
